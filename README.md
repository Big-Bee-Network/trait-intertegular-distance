[![SWH](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/badge/origin/https://github.com/Big-Bee-Network/trait-intertegular-distance/)](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/?origin_url=https://github.com/Big-Bee-Network/trait-intertegular-distance)

Repository with datasets measuring intertegular distance from the [Big Bee project](https://big-bee.net). Measurements were recorded using Notes From Nature data portal and microscope measurements. 

## data description
Each folder contains several files:
* 22794_reconciled.csv - reconciled using Notes from Nature
* 22794_summary.html - Summary of the data collection including number of people who participated online
* 22794_unreconciled.csv - unreconciled data, suggested to use this file for evaluating datasets
* ucsbees-measurements-classifications.csv - ?

## trait definition
Intertegular distance is measured based on Cane, 1987

## protocols used to measure ITS in submitted data
Several methods are used to measure ITS within this dataset. Those methods are described here.

**Crowd source measurements via Notes from Nature:** using a custom measurement tool in Notes From Nature. Five measurements are created from five different users on Notes from Nature. Measurements are reconciled to one measurement. See tutorial on [https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/md68135/notes-from-nature-big-bee-bonanza](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/md68135/notes-from-nature-big-bee-bonanza).

**Measured under microscope:** measured under microscope using graticule.
